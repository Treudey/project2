# Time to Go TO

Time to Go is the quickest, simplest way of finding an amazing public washroom near you when nature calls. The app's map shows the public toilets closest to you that have been submitted and reviewed by other users. Green means good to go. Red means proceed with caution. And, if you need to know all the details, touch each map point for a full review. Have a throne you love to worship? Please add it. We're all in this together!
